# Note-Sort
Creates a Random Array of Midi-Notes from a set of inputs and sorts them according to different algorithms. Every iteration of the sorting process gets linearly applied to a new midi file. You also get Random Velocity, Note Length and Pauses. <br>
Tip: Use multiple iterations or variations of the sorting algorithm but use the same input notes (or other harmonic notes) to create multiple instrument parts.
